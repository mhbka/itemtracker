    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    <div>
      Have you ever needed to watch a marketplace like eBay or Mercari, 
      <br />
      for some rare item that only popped up once in a blue moon, 
      <br />
      or for the chance of a bargain deal on something normally overpriced,
      <br />
      but you don't have the time to sit there and check it every day?
      <br />
      <br />
      No?
      <br />
      <br />
      That's fine; most people don't, so you can click away now. But if this sounds like something you do, we might be able to help!
      This service lets you:
      <ul>
        <li>scrape marketplace<s>s</s> (Mercari only for now), as often as you'd like</li>
        <li>set questions to ask an LLM about each item to profile it for you + filter out what you don't want</li>
        <li>gather the curated items in a nice neat place</li>
      </ul>
      If this sounds like something you might need, watch this space, for we'll be up and running soon!
